# The Office MongoDB
You recently created a new company in the `GAMING industry`. The company will have the following scheme:

- 20 Designers
- 5 UI/UX Engineers
- 10 Frontend Developers
- 15 Data Engineers
- 5 Backend Developers
- 20 Account Managers
- 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball
- 10 Executives
- 1 CEO/President

As a data engineer you have asked all the employees to show their preferences on where to place the new office. Your goal is to place the **new company offices** in the best place for the company to grow. You have to found a place that more or less covers all the following requirements. Note that **it's impossible to cover all requirements**, so you have to prioritize at your glance.

Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not to far.
Account managers need to travel a lot

I chose Seattle as the city, that follows all the requests
